Description: SigRescueR applies bayesian inference to remove baseline mutational signatures from
 the exposed sample mutational spectra. SigRescueR relies on the exposed sample count data and the 
 normalized baseline signature to estimate the activity of the baseline and exposure while inferring
 the exposure-associated mutation signature. It supports single and multi-background profiles and
 perform parallel processing when multiple exposed samples are provided. SigRescueR can be applied 
 to any SBS channels, including SBS-96 and SBS-288 classifications.
